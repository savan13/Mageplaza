# Mageplaza
Our Magento module allows you to collect your customer reviews in just a few clicks and to manage them in an ethical and transparent manner.

**Your site reviews** <br/>
Easily display your site reviews from your home page via the available widgets. If you decide to display them, you can then customize their location and appearance.

**Your product reviews** <br/>
They are your best asset to boost your visibility and sales! Give a voice to your customers thanks to the widgets that appear on your product sheets. Each new notice published is displayed, enriching the content of your product sheets.

**Your store reviews** <br/>
You can now solicit the opinions of your customers who have made a purchase in your physical store. By sending them a request for advice via our module, you take into account each of your customers, and that's essential!

**Review request** <br/>
We take care of the process of collecting feedbacks via email notification requests. They are automatically sent to your customers who have previously placed an order on your store, and guarantee a return rate of about 13%.

**Google stars and Rich Snippets**<br/>
Increase your visibility on search engines! The module automatically displays the scores assigned to your product listings via Google stars. These will ensure a better natural referencing and will increase your conversion rate.

**Trusted Attestation**<br/>
A major argument for your legitimacy as a merchant, we deliver you a Trusted Attestation signed by our hand, in order to reassure your customers about the transparency of the opinions published on your website.
